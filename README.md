## Project Description
CovidStatisticsTableau is a project that generates a dashboard for visualization based on computed data from the previous CovidStatistics project. The dashboard provides visual insights into COVID-19 metrics such as deaths, vaccinations, location, continent, and percent of the population infected. Data for the dashboard is derived from tables generated by running SQL queries on a relational database.

## Installation Instructions
To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Download the tables required for the project 'CovidDeaths','CovidVaccinations'.
2. Load these tables into a relational database of your choice.
3. Run the SQL query file provided with this project in your database. Save the results of each query as separate tables.
